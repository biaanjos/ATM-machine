High-Level Programming Languages -Midterm Project 

Create ten accounts in a list with the ids 0, 1, ..., 9, and an initial balance of $100. The system prompts the user to enter an id. If the id is entered incorrectly, ask the user to enter the correct id. Once an id is accepted, the main menu is displayed, as shown in the sample run. You can enter a choice of 1 for viewing the current balance, 2 forwithdrawing money, 3 for depositing money, and 4 for exiting the main menu. Once you exit, the system will prompt for an id again. So, once the system starts, it won't
stop.
